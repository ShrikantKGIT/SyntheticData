**Data synthesis and augmentation**: These techniques are used to create new training data for machine learning models. This can be done by generating synthetic data, or by augmenting existing data with new variations.

**Data exhaustion crisis**: This refers to the problem of running out of high-quality data to train machine learning models on. This can lead to models that are less accurate and less reliable.

**Data generation techniques**: These are the methods used to create new training data. They include techniques such as synthetic data generation, data augmentation, and transfer learning.
